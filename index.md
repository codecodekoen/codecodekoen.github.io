SARS-CoV-2 Superspreading Events Database

As knowledge of COVID-19 increases, it is becoming increasingly clear that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not homogeneous. Instead, certain events magnify transmission: such "superspreading" could be driven by biological, social or environmental factors. To inform how we move forward to control this virus we need to break this problem down by considering each of these factors separately. In this work we take the last part, and look to pull together all data on settings in which it is known that transmission occurred.

Project's Aim:  To collate international data on the settings in which transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to occur and to present our findings in a publicly accessible database.

Using this information we can 

1.  Inform what settings are more or less risky

2.  Support decision making around lockdown "exit strategies

3.  Explore the impact of lockdowns on settings

Database

-   [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c9jwMyT1lw2P0d6SDTno6nHLGMtpheO9xJyGHgdBoco/edit#gid=1812932356): view the database; download or make a copy to edit and sort

-   Bubble map: shows all the superspreading events in the database on a world map

-   Bubble map with timeline: an animated timeline showing the events as they occurred

Volunteers

We are always looking for new superspreading events to add to the database. If you come across any or if you would like to commit some time to do a more systematic search please contact us at <info@superspreadingdatabase.com>. We are particularly interested in assistance with searching non-English language literature.

In addition to finding new examples we are also looking for volunteers to help us investigate, verify and systematize information about the events already in the database, using a categorization framework we have set up for this purpose. See this documentation for more information. Contact us if you'd like to be of assistance. 

Data Analysis

We welcome further interrogation of the data we have collected. Contact us if you need assistance, would like to cooperate on research or would like to share your findings with us.  

Media Inquiries

Journalists looking for more information about the SARS-CoV-2 Superspreading Events Database project or about the phenomenon of superspreading events in general, can contact us at <contact@superspreadingdatabase.com>
